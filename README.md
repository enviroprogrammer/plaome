# PLAOME (PLANT + HOME)
For the "Tech for a Greener Future" challenge hosted by RBC, we developed a prototype of an app called "Plaome" to promote urban gardening. We specifically used a community-oriented approach when designing the app. Community members can use Plaome to support each other in creating community gardens as well as their own personal gardens.
